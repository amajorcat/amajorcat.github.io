Workshop ‘Beyond Questionnaires: Innovative Approaches to Evaluating Mixed Reality’ posed the question as to whether survey-based evaluation was really the best fit for evaluating Mixed Reality. This workshop aimed to bring researchers together to come up with ideas for new and exciting research directions where evaluation is more tightly coupled to experience that is being evaluated. This brings to mind the Voxbox (Golsteijn et al., 2015) which sought to obtain feedback from live events using a tangible machine with different and fun interactions as a substitute for the more traditional person with a clipboard.
