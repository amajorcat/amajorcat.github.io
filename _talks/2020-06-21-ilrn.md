The doctoral colloquium is a concentrated full-day event where students present their research interests/plans/results to a panel of researchers in the field and receive specific constructive feedback, including opportunities to meet with mentors one-on-one. Accepted students will be expected to give in-depth presentations of their research and will receive constructive comments from mentors. Additionally, accepted students will create a poster about their work to allow conference attendees to quickly familiarize themselves with each otherâ€™s work and to be shown to a broader audience during the conference poster session.
