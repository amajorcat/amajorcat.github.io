If you have been teaching, what was your overall experience? 
(e.g., please give some detail regarding positive or negative experiences).
-----


Positive: The demonstration gave me a chance to review my knowledge by doing the practical and explaining it to others; gave me a chance to talk to people, maintaining the basic socialise level in the isolated research daily routine. As a TA, it was my responsibility to arrange the lab, which also helped me practice my ability in planning and executing. 


Negative: Need to spend some time. 


If you have not been teaching, why not? Please provide some context around your decision not to teach (e.g., full-time employment, health issues, funding issues, etc).
-----

Not capable.


Have you taken any training to improve your teaching skills? Would you take any such training if it was available?

No, and Yes.
