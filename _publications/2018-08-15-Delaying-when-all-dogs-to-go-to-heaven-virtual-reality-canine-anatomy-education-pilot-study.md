excerpt: 'Virtual Reality(VR} has long been theorized as a perfect training tool. The success in training airline pilots using flight simulators has demonstrated this be true in one use case. This has logically lead to interest in exploring ways of training other professionals such as Doctors and Veterinarians. This paper takes a different approach in examining the use of VR in summative rather than formative assessment. It reports on how using open source tools, CT scans can be converted into a working 3D model that can be used to assess anatomy students abilities. These students already have individual access to a cadaver which would be considered the gold standard method of Anatomy education. So the research problem is to examine the advantages of summative assessment using VR where currently best practise is merely a multiple choice exam(MCQ).'

Virtual Reality(VR} has long been theorized as a perfect training tool. The success in training airline pilots using flight simulators has demonstrated this be true in one use case. This has logically lead to interest in exploring ways of training other professionals such as Doctors and Veterinarians. This paper takes a different approach in examining the use of VR in summative rather than formative assessment. It reports on how using open source tools, CT scans can be converted into a working 3D model that can be used to assess anatomy students abilities. These students already have individual access to a cadaver which would be considered the gold standard method of Anatomy education. So the research problem is to examine the advantages of summative assessment using VR where currently best practise is merely a multiple choice exam(MCQ).
