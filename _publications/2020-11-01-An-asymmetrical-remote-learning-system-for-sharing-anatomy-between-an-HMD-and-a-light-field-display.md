excerpt: 'VR remote learning is an environment-friendly approach for anatomy learning compared with the paper-based, physical model or prepared specimens. However, VR devices can potentially be costly pieces of equipment, and inexperienced users can experience unwanted symptoms like motion sickness. To solve these problems, an asymmetrical system has been developed to connect an experienced head-mounted-display user (lecturer) with light field display users (students) through the Internet. The scenes of lecturer&apos;s end and students&apos; end are adjusted to match the corresponding displays technologies.'

VR remote learning is an environment-friendly approach for anatomy learning compared with the paper-based, physical model or prepared specimens. However, VR devices can potentially be costly pieces of equipment, and inexperienced users can experience unwanted symptoms like motion sickness. To solve these problems, an asymmetrical system has been developed to connect an experienced head-mounted-display user (lecturer) with light field display users (students) through the Internet. The scenes of lecturer&apos;s end and students&apos; end are adjusted to match the corresponding displays technologies.
